<p>In our work, we design and implement computer vision techniques to a variety of areas. In one work, we use a convolutional neural network to detect emotional affect in facial imagery. As in many computer vision problems, the availability of training data with ground truth labels is a limiting factor. In our work, we leverage a large dataset without ground truth labels and show improvement in performance in the data of interest. In another work, we implemented a real-time system to detect flaws in a microencapsulation system. Our classification algorithm actuated a valve that improved the quality of resulting microcapsules in real-time.</p>

<h3 id="pulse-shape-discrimination">Pulse shape discrimination</h3>
<p>Detailed signals acquired from scintillator devices can be used to distinguish nuclear particles, such as neutrons and gammas. In the low energy regime, standard heuristic approaches often fail to correctly classify particle type. I developed techniques leveraging statistical modeling approaches to enable more accurate classification for lower particle energies. The models are based on partially observed ground truth (labels) for each pulse that is recorded and consist of mixtures of unknown Gaussian templates. We implemented and brought the software design of the required algorithms to a high level of software engineering, including a fast FPGA implementation.</p>

<h3 id="cardiovascular-biometrics">Cardiovascular biometrics</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular activity can be measured noninvasively and with noncontact sensors. Electrical activity can be recorded using the traditional Electrocardiogram (ECG) setup, but hemodynamics can also be captured in the mechanical domain. We developed the use of Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV), which can be used to measure surface vibrations, for remote sensing of cardiovascular activity. I designed and implemented models and associated algorithms for LDVs signals acquired from the skin overlying the carotid artery. These signals can be acquired in a noncontact and standoff manner and they represent underlying hemodynamics in the carotid. The models capture varying scales of temporal dynamics reflected in the signal. At the lowest level, millisecond level dynamics due to the underlying blood pressure are observed. At the next level, cardiorespiratory effects alter the shape of the pulse across heartbeat. At the higher levels, changes occurring on longer times scales were considered. This work enables the use of the LDV in clinical settings where skin contact is either unavailable or undesirable, such as the case with MRI gating or neonatal patients. In addition to LDV, we also performed a comparative analysis of methods for biometric identity verification using traditional Electrocardiogram data.</p>
